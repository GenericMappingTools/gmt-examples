# Contributing Guidelines

:tada: **First off, thank you for considering contributing to our project!** :tada:

This is a community-driven project, so it's people like you that make it useful and
successful.
These are some of the many ways to contribute:

* :bug: Submitting bug reports and feature requests
* :memo: Writing tutorials or examples
* :mag: Fixing typos and improving the documentation
* :people_holding_hands: Community engagement and outreach

If you get stuck at any point you can create an
[issue](https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/gmt-examples/issues) on GitHub or
get in touch through the [GMT Forum](https://forum.generic-mapping-tools.org/).
